Moles & Avogadro's Constant
We use moles for measurements. The main measure of chemical amounts are moles, with mol as the unit.
We can compare moles to relative formula mass. The mass of one mole of a substance is equal to the relative formula mass in grams. For example, Boron has an Ar of 11, so one mole of Boron would weigh 11g exactly.

## Avogadro's Constant
    A mole is a number. The word "mole" stands for a particular number. This is known as the Avogadro Constant. Just as the word "dozen"  represents the number "12", the mole represents the number represented by Avogadro's constant.

    The Avogadro constant is a number. The Avogadro constant is the number of atoms, molecules or ions in a mole of the given substance. We state it as 6.02 x 1023 atoms per mole.

    Avogadro's number and moles. One mole of any substance contains 6.02 x 1023 particles. To determine the number of moles in a given number of particles, we can use the equation
